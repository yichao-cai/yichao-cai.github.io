## About this blog

This is my personal blog. I intend to document some of my own
thinking, coding tips, and knowledge roadmap related to python, R,
emacs, bioinformatics, and machine learning.

## About me

I am a bioinformatics scientist with a background of human genomics,
epigenetics, cancer biology, and machine learning.
